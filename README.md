## Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project explores customer segmentation techniques to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** The initial data underwent cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand customer characteristics and identify potential patterns.
2. **K-Means Clustering:** K-means clustering was applied to group customers into initial segments based on their features. 
3. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality and visualize the clusters in a lower-dimensional space, aiding in cluster interpretation.
4. **Autoencoder Refinement:** An autoencoder was employed to de-noise the data and potentially refine the segmentation. This process led to a more focused view with four distinct customer segments.
5. **Final Cluster Validation:** PCA was again applied on the final clusters with the main data to confirm the presence of the four well-defined customer segments.

**Outcomes:**

* Identified four distinct customer segments with unique characteristics.
* Gained deeper insights into customer behavior for targeted marketing strategies.
* Improved understanding of customer base for enhanced customer experience.

**Future Work:**

* Integrate additional customer data sources for potentially richer segmentation.
* Develop predictive models leveraging the segments for personalized marketing and customer service.
* Continuously monitor and adapt segmentation strategies based on evolving customer behavior.
* Explore explainable AI techniques to understand the factors driving customer segmentation.

**Getting Started:**

This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the customer segmentation process. Refer to the notebook for specific code and results.

**Dependencies:**

* pandas (data manipulation)
* scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
* matplotlib & seaborn (data visualization)
* (Optional) TensorFlow or PyTorch (for autoencoders)

**Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different techniques to further refine the customer segmentation!**
